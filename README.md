# How Early can you Retire?

... Work in progress

## About

After reading Mr. Money Moustache's [The Shockingly Simple Math Behind Early Retirement](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/), I was inspired to map out various other scenarios. There are some valid criticisms of the piece that I won't dig into, but my main takeaway was a series of questions: "This page assumes I want to live off my pre-retirement budget; What if I wanted to hold off on retiring so I can be mega-comfortable? What if I retire *too* early? What would the scenarios look like if I compared the full set of savings rates against the full set of possible years saved?"

## Assumptions

This visualization project operates on a set of assumptions that might differ from reality, but are there for the sake of simplicity:

* Your portfolio return is constant 5% *(Reality: It will change from year to year depending on your mix of US stocks, bonds, international stocks, and cash; and market fluctuations)*
* Your income never changes *(Reality: Your income will usually increase over time)*
* You will have the same expenses in retirement *(Reality: Your expenses are usually lower in retirement)*
* You will never change your savings rate.
* You will never withdraw the investments until retirement.
* Taxes are not taken into account *(Reality: Your tax situation may be different due to changes in income, changes in politics, or changes in your allocations to certain brokerage accounts e.g. Roth, Traditional, Taxable)*
* Social Security is not taken into account *(Reality: If you are young and live in the US, it's projected that you will still have 75% of the promised benefits of Social Security)*

## Exploration and Explanations

If you were to ask me, "Zoni, what's more important: my desired income or desired budget?" I would reply with the fact that it's your **desired budget** Since a vast majority of us are not going to save 100% of our income, and we'll likely want to call it quits after working from the ages of 25 to 65.

So let's assume a max working time of 40 years, and a max savings rate of 60%, and replot. In addition to this, let's also mark an area on our plot to define what some people recommend:

* Elizabeth Warren recommends saving 20% of your income in her [50-30-20 rule](https://www.gobankingrates.com/personal-finance/senator-elizabeth-warren-50-30-20-budget-rule-save-pay-off-debt/) (from *All Your Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan*)
* William Bernstein recommends saving 15% of your income in his 16-page pamphlet *[If You Can](https://www.etf.com/docs/IfYouCan.pdf)*
* Let's assume their advice is to save for between 35 and 40 years.

Let's see how this pans out:

Looks like their advice is to save 15% to 20% is, for a lack of better phrasing, *right on the money*.
