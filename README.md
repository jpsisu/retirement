# How Early can you Retire?

... Work in progress

## About

After reading Mr. Money Moustache's [The Shockingly Simple Math Behind Early Retirement](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/), I was inspired to map out various other scenarios. There are some valid criticisms of the piece that I won't dig into, but my main takeaway was a series of questions: "This page assumes I want to live off my pre-retirement budget; What if I wanted to hold off on retiring so I can be mega-comfortable? What if I retire *too* early? What would the scenarios look like if I compared the full set of savings rates against the full set of possible years saved?"

## Assumptions

This visualization project operates on a set of assumptions that might differ from reality, but are there for the sake of simplicity:

* Your portfolio return is constant 5% *(**Reality:** It will change from year to year depending on your mix of US stocks, bonds, international stocks, and cash; and market fluctuations)*
* Your income never changes *(**Reality:** Your income will usually increase over time)*
* You will have the same expenses in retirement *(**Reality:** Your expenses are usually lower in retirement)*
* You will never change your savings rate.
* You will never withdraw the investments until retirement.
* Taxes are not taken into account *(**Reality:** Your tax situation may be different due to changes in income, changes in politics, or changes in your allocations to certain brokerage accounts e.g. Roth, Traditional, Taxable)*
* Social Security is not taken into account *(**Reality:** If you are young and live in the US, it's projected that you will still have 75% of the promised benefits of Social Security)*
