# How Early can you Retire?

... Work in progress

## About

After reading Mr. Money Moustache's [The Shockingly Simple Math Behind Early Retirement](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/), I was inspired to map out various other scenarios. There are some valid criticisms of the piece that I won't dig into, but my main takeaway was a series of questions: "This page assumes I want to live off my pre-retirement budget; What if I wanted to hold off on retiring so I can be mega-comfortable? What if I retire *too* early? What would the scenarios look like if I compared the full set of savings rates against the full set of possible years saved?"

## Assumptions

This visualization project operates on a set of assumptions that might differ from reality, but are there for the sake of simplicity:

* Your portfolio return is constant 5% *(Reality: It will change from year to year depending on your mix of US stocks, bonds, international stocks, and cash; and market fluctuations)*
* Your income never changes *(Reality: Your income will usually increase over time)*
* You will have the same expenses in retirement *(Reality: Your expenses are usually lower in retirement)*
* You will never change your savings rate.
* You will never withdraw the investments until retirement.
* Taxes are not taken into account *(Reality: Your tax situation may be different due to changes in income, changes in politics, or changes in your allocations to certain brokerage accounts e.g. Roth, Traditional, Taxable)*
* Social Security is not taken into account *(Reality: If you are young and live in the US, it's projected that you will still have 75% of the promised benefits of Social Security)*

## Exploration and Explanations

If you were to ask me, "Zoni, what's more important: my desired income or desired budget?" I would reply with the fact that it's your **desired budget**, because it also measures what you can live on after retirement.

Since a vast majority of us are not going to save 100% of our income, and we'll likely want to call it quits after working from the ages of 25 to 65. So let's assume a max working time of 40 years, and a max savings rate of 60%, and replot. In addition to this, let's also mark an area on our plot to define what some experts recommend:

* Elizabeth Warren recommends saving 20% of your income in her [50-30-20 rule](https://www.gobankingrates.com/personal-finance/senator-elizabeth-warren-50-30-20-budget-rule-save-pay-off-debt/) (from *All Your Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan*)
* William Bernstein recommends saving 15% of your income in his 16-page pamphlet *[If You Can](https://www.etf.com/docs/IfYouCan.pdf)*
* Let's assume their advice is to save for between 35 and 40 years.

There are some financial experts who recommend 10%, but as you can see from a prior plot, you'd need to work until the age of 75 in order to retire on 1x your budget. Looks like Warren and Bernstein's advice to save 15%-20% is, for a lack of better phrasing, *right on the money*.

How does this look when we add the [US Personal Savings Rate](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-states/personal-savings) as a vertical line to the plot?

As of this writing, the US Personal Savings Rate is currently 5.5%, however [including employer match](http://www.fool.com/investing/2016/10/03/heres-the-average-americans-savings-rate.aspx) we thankfully get a little closer to 8.5%. But if you're relying entirely on your personal savings to retire, that would give you a little less than half your income by the time you come of age. Luckily, for some of these folk, they will have Social Security and pensions, but those are fading as time goes by.
