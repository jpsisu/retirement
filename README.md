### Assumptions:

This visualization project operates on a simple set of assumptions:

* Your portfolio return is constant 5% (**Reality:** It will change from year to year depending on your mix of US stocks, bonds, international stocks, and cash; and market fluctuations)
* Your income never changes (**Reality:** Your income will usually increase over time)
* You will have the same expenses in retirement (**Reality:** Your expenses are usually lower in retirement)
* You will never change your savings rate.
* You will never withdraw the investments until retirement.
* Taxes are not taken into account (**Reality:** Your tax situation may be different due to changes in income, changes in politics, or changes in your allocations to certain brokerage accounts e.g. Roth, Traditional, Taxable)
* Social Security is not taken into account (**Reality:** If you are young and live in the US, it's projected that you will have 75% of the promised benefits of Social Security)
